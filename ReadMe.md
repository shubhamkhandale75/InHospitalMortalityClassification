# In Hospital Mortality Prediction

```sh
Dataset: In Hospital Mortality Prediction Dataset from MIMIC-III database

```

### Motivation/Goal:

The goal of the project is to create a classification model to classify whether a patient will experience in-hospital mortality or not, based on the data obtained from patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for Heart Failure. The models focused on are Logistic Regression, Decision tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors. EDA, Feature Selection, and Dimensionality Reduction will be used to manipulate the dataset before modeling.

Additionally, categorical variables will be used to stratify the data into groups so that we can perform hypothesis testing and test classification model performance over these different groups. The categorical variables to be analyzed will be determined using Random Forest.
